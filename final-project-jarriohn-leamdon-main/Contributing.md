# Overview
Our game "Quest for the Forbidden Sauce" is a game made in Java using Eclipse. It is primarily a 2D Top-Down game with mechanics of a bullet hell and turn based battle game. 

Play as a chef missing the one ingredient to make the greatest dish in the land. Rumor has it, that a "Taco of the North" guards this ingredient. Allow your desperation to motivate you through the challenges you might face to achieve your dream of "The greatest chef in the world".

## System Requirements
### Minimum: 
- Monitor: Color Display, minimum 800 x 600
- OS: Windows, MacOS, Linux as long as either of the following have the Eclipse Java IDE installed.
- Wired or wireless Keyboard

# Implemented Features
Our game implements many of the features that we originally imagined when chalking up the idea. Our features include:
- A functional start and settings menu
![Start Screen](/media/imageStart.png "Start Screen")
- original (but muteable) music playing through all aspects of game
- a random item each playthrough that affects gameplay if picked up
- smooth player and enemy movement during bullet-hell
- bullets to dodge being hurled at the player from different directions

- smooth transitions from bullet-hell top down to turn-based-battles
- appropriate win and loss screens based on outcome with option to continue

However, we were not able to implement everything exactly like we invisioned. Features that were left out include:
- a less useless defend button for turn-based-battles
- more rooms that differ from each other
- better animations for attack and defend during turn-based-battles
- boss cutscenes/introductory frames

# How to Build/Play
The "Quest for Forbidden Sauce" game was built through Eclipe utilizing the java programming language.

We were provided classes to start, but were able to create our own classes for the better functionality of our game.

In Eclipse, to run the program, right click the the project and choose run as java application. Lastly select the MainApplication from the program.

To begin the adventure, players would have to click the start button on the main menu. The player will then be put into a room with a chest. Players can use 'WASD' on their keyboards to move and use 'E' to interact with the chest.

Lastly, during the Turn-Based Battle portion of the game, players will either have to click attack or defend in order to defeat the enemies that try to stop you from getting the sauce.
